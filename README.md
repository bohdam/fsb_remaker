FSB Remaker
Shadps4 FSB Remaker for Bloodborne(may partly work with other games, also works ONLY with installed game on shados4 main branch for now)

I’m working on a program that generates deciphered FSB files from the audio in Bloodborne, which first needs to be converted using foobar2000. I'm open to help (because I’m too lazy to do it all by myself!).

While it’s possible to do this manually, it’s a huge pain to handle over 500 files.

Steps:
1. Use foobar2000 along with the "VGStream" and "Encoder Pack" modules to convert all the audio files from the "sound" folder in Bloodborne.
2. Select all the FSB files in the folder and load them into foobar2000.
3. Go to the Edit menu and click Delete All Dead Items.
4. Click Edit again, select Select All, right-click on the files, and choose Convert.
5. A conversion settings window will open. Select Output Format and choose OGG or another preferred format.
6. Go back and select Destination to choose where the converted files should be saved.
7. Click Convert and let the process run—it may take some time.
After conversion, run folder_sort.py to organize and rename the files. The script will sort the files into newly created folders, making it easier to generate the FSB files.

At this point, you’ll need to configure special settings to create an FSB file for each folder. Unfortunately, progress is currently stuck at this stage.
I am trying to open an FMOD Designer file (FDP), which is an XML file, replace the sounds with the required ones, and build an FSB file using each folder's name as generated by the folder_sort.py script.

If you want to manually build an FSB file, you need to complete all the previous steps, then open the FEV file in the sound folder to see how the FSB file is structured. Create a similar bank in the FEV file using the OGG files (each folder should correspond to an FSB file). After building it, replace the original FSB file in the sound folder with the new one.
